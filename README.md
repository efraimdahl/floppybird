# [play floppy bird]( https://efraimdahl.github.io/floppybird/)

Floppy bird reconfigured to take microphone input.
The microphone input will only grab once the you have clicked a few times... So before the Pipes start, you should use the mouse or the space bar. Then its hands off time.

Used Nebez Briefkani browser rebuild of Floppy Bird as a basis (find it here: https://github.com/nebez/floppybird)
For the audio grabbing I used a html5 Volume meter: (find it here: https://github.com/cwilso/volume-meter)

**Features**

* üéâ good ol' div's for all the objects and graphics,
* üñ• scales perfectly on almost any screen, both mobile and desktop,
* üí© unoptimized, laggy, and not nearly as fast as a canvas implementation,
* üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è unfinished typescript version (see `/ts` folder),

Enjoy.
